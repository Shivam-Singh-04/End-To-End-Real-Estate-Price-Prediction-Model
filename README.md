# End-To-End-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Model
Real Estate Price Prediction is the process of estimating or forecasting the future prices of real estate properties, such as houses, apartments, or commercial buildings. The goal is to provide accurate property rates to buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions about real estate transactions. For the task of Real Estate Price Prediction, we need historical data with various features that can influence property prices. The dataset used here is Real Estate data from [Statso](https://statso.io/real-estate-prediction-case-study/).
The dataset contains 7 columns: Transaction date, House age, Distance to the nearest station(m), Number of convenience stores, Latitude, Longitude and House price of unit area. We will find the relation between the first six parameters and house price and then conclude that what exactly is more crucial in predicting the house price of unit area.
